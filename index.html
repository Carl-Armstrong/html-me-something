                    My passion is story telling. I have spent hundreds of
                    hours studying the art and attempting to
                    reverse engineer the secrets of the masters. Here is a
                    small sample of my work:

                <p>When Dalton sought the Dark Powers, tuberkinesis hadn’t been his 
                    first choice... or even his last. He hadn’t even known it was a 
                    choice. But the Powers granted whatever abilities they saw fit, so
                    Dalton got the ability to control potatoes with his mind.
                </p>
                <p>It was a lot more useful than he had first expected. Flying 
                    potatoes weren’t the most powerful weapon, but they were ubiquitous. 
                    Dalton used them to overwhelm opponents and intimidate peons. 
                    And that was only the basic level of his ability. Dalton had recently discovered
                    that he could spy on anyone within two miles if they were near a potato.
                </p>
                <p>Up to now, Dalton was, as one of the Powers had put it, “small 
                    potatoes,” but if things worked out today, that would change. He 
                    was preparing for a showdown with Fleur Gagne, a woman who had been 
                    granted her own ability by the Powers – the ability to gift 
                    intelligence to plants. If he could force her to do his bidding,
                    world domination would shift from a pipe dream to a feasible goal.
                     First step would be to get through her garden. Obviously, he would
                     start with the potato patch.

                        Though most of them aren't based around silly puns.
