                    Telling stories is my passion. I have spent hundreds of
                    hours studying the art of story telling and attempting to
                    reverse engineer the secrets of the masters. Here is a
                    small sample of my work:

                <p>When Dalton sought the Dark Powers, tuberkinesis hadn’t been his 
                    first choice. In fact, he hadn’t even known it was a choice. But 
                    the Powers granted whatever abilities they saw fit, so now, 
                    Dalton controlled potatoes with his mind.
                </p>
                <p>It was a lot more useful than he had first expected. Flying 
                    potatoes weren’t the most powerful weapon, but they were plentiful, and 
                    Dalton had used them to overwhelm opponents and intimidate peons. 
                    But as useful as that was, Dalton made better use of his potatoes'
                    eyes. He could spy on anyone within two miles, if they were near a potato.
                </p>
                <p>Up to now, Dalton was, as one of the Powers had put it, “small 
                    potatoes,” but if things worked out today, that would change. He 
                    was preparing for a showdown with Fleur Gagne, a woman who had been 
                    granted her own ability by the Powers – the ability to grant 
                    intelligence to plants. Her ability bent to his will would be a major 
                    boost to his plans for domination. But first, he would need to get 
                    through her garden. Luckily for him, she had some potatoes.
